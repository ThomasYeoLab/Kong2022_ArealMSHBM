Data
====

In this study we utillized HCP S1200 dataset. We will release parcellations and FC matrices of 1024 HCP subjects passed our postrocessing pipeline. The parcellations and FC matrices include 100, 200, ..., 1000 reslutions.

The subject list can be found here: link_to_be_add

Note: we will move parcellations and FC to BALSA once the BALSA link is made public. The BALSA link will be: https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/Pr8jD

Parcellation Release
====

For each resolution, the relevant parcellations for all HCP subjects were saved as a `64984 x 1029` matrix, where each column corresponds to the parcellation of a single subject. The subject order list can be found in here: link_to_be_add.

For resolution K, the individual areal-level parcellations can be found here:

Parcellation Release
====

For resolution K, the relevant FC for all HCP subjects were saved as a `K x K x 1029` matrix, where the 3rd dimension corresponds to subject orderring. The subject order list can be found in here: link_to_be_add.

For resolution K, FC matrices generated by individual areal-level parcellations can be found here:
